## About The Project

Batch Payments is a robust solution designed to simplify the process of managing multiple invoices. With its user-centric design, you can efficiently pay several purchase invoices in one go, generate an Australian Banking Association (ABA) file for outbound payments to various parties, and create and send remittance advice emails. 

### Key Features:

- Pay multiple purchase invoices in one batch
- Generate ABA files for outbound payments
- Send remittance advice emails to parties

## Technical Stack and Setup Instructions

Batch Payments is built on the solid foundation of the Framework. To get started with Batch Payments, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/empress-eco/batch_payments.git`
2. Create a bank record and populate the `Financial Institution Abbreviation` custom field with a max 3 char abbreviation for the bank (e.g. CBA, ANZ).
3. Create a bank account linked to this bank, and populate the `Branch Code` with the BSB number in 000-000 format (e.g. 065-125).
4. Continue to populate the required fields as instructed [in the original instructions as given](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7692091).

### Usage

The Batch Payment record will allow you to select a bank account for payments to be made from, select a date, select a posting date, and save the record. You can then filter suppliers and purchase invoices as required, select those you wish to pay, and create the payments.
